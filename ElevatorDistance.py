# Give you two arrays representing an elevator problem, one array represents the weight of each person, the second one represents the floor they looking to reach,
# for example:
# [60, 20, 80, 180, 60]
# and
# [2, 2, 3, 3, 5]
# And the maximum weight the elevator can carry: for this problem, use 200
# Question: what's the least amount of distance the elevator has to travel? (From floor 1 to floor 2, distance would be 2-1=1)
# Assume everyone starts on the first floor, and the elevator has to come back to the first floor to pick up every group.
# Assume people cannot skip the line. ie. 60 and 20 have to go before 80.
